The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to secrets scanning detecting secrets in the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the secrets mentioned in the error message (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY, STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) are not exposed in any files or part of the build output.
2. If these secrets are intended to be used, follow the instructions provided in the error message to prevent detection or exposure.
3. Review the build scripts to ensure no secrets are hardcoded or exposed during the build process to avoid triggering the secrets scanning mechanism again.
