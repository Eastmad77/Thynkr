      Whether you’re a casual learner or a high-performance thinker, Whylee adapts to your pace.</p>

      <h3>Behind the Design</h3>
      <p>Developed by Connetics’ Lighting & Smart Cities Team as a passion project, Whylee draws inspiration from neuroscience, UX design, and interactive learning research. 
      Every screen is designed for clarity, purpose, and flow — no clutter, just focus.</p>
